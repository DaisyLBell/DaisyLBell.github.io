    <h2> <div class= book-title> Vaster Than Empires and More Slow </div> by Ursula le Guin</h2>
    <p>
        The Ursula Le Guin reading was an interesting science fiction allegory<br/>
        for issues that we see in real life. I know in class we talked about<br/>
        the ways that the new planet represents our planet Earth after the<br/>
        introduction and growth of the Internet - the way it is an undercurrent<br/>
        to our reality or our natural lives. However, I recognized the new<br/>
        planet as an allegory for the rural areas that have the Internet and<br/>
        Western technologies introduced. The way the planet reacted poorly, or<br/>
        the inhabitants felt afraid of the colonists. Also, Osden represented a<br/>
        translator figure between the colonists and the inhabitants. It is<br/>
        interesting that he was the first of the characters to fully understand<br/>
        the thoughts of the inhabitants, more interesting that the colonists<br/>
        adopted the inhabitants’ fear and that they acted in an empathetic<br/>
        fashion. This event is most likely the reason why the colonists left,<br/>
        and how this version of colonialism does not look like ours.<br/>
        This way of analyzing the short story, or the events in the short story<br/>
        also relates to our version of technological colonialism. I will never<br/>
        forget when I was informed that even tribal lands in Africa had access<br/>
        to 3G cell service at a Model United Nations conference in Vancouver,<br/>
        BC. Access to technology in rural areas of the world, or places that<br/>
        would be deemed “off the grid” creates opportunity but also indicates<br/>
        how prominent and inconsiderate Western tradition is abroad.
