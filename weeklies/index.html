    <h2> <div class= book-title> Vaster Than Empires and More Slow </div> by Ursula le Guin</h2>
    <p>
        The Ursula Le Guin reading was an interesting science fiction allegory<br/>
        for issues that we see in real life. I know in class we talked about<br/>
        the ways that the new planet represents our planet Earth after the<br/>
        introduction and growth of the Internet - the way it is an undercurrent<br/>
        to our reality or our natural lives. However, I recognized the new<br/>
        planet as an allegory for the rural areas that have the Internet and<br/>
        Western technologies introduced. The way the planet reacted poorly, or<br/>
        the inhabitants felt afraid of the colonists. Also, Osden represented a<br/>
        translator figure between the colonists and the inhabitants. It is<br/>
        interesting that he was the first of the characters to fully understand<br/>
        the thoughts of the inhabitants, more interesting that the colonists<br/>
        adopted the inhabitants’ fear and that they acted in an empathetic<br/>
        fashion. This event is most likely the reason why the colonists left,<br/>
        and how this version of colonialism does not look like ours.<br/>
        This way of analyzing the short story, or the events in the short story<br/>
        also relates to our version of technological colonialism. I will never<br/>
        forget when I was informed that even tribal lands in Africa had access<br/>
        to 3G cell service at a Model United Nations conference in Vancouver,<br/>
        BC. Access to technology in rural areas of the world, or places that<br/>
        would be deemed “off the grid” creates opportunity but also indicates<br/>
        how prominent and inconsiderate Western tradition is abroad.

      <h2>"In Defense of the Poor Image" by Hito Steyerl</h2>
      <p> Here are a few images from home and from times with my friends<br/>
        that relate to the reading. They are posterized, such that I<br/>
        made them poor quality images. This does not confront the part<br/>
        of the article that addresses poor image and its relation to video,<br/>
        but, by posterizing these images, I created my response to the reading.</p>

      <h2>All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace: Episode II</h2>
      <p>The definition of cybernetics, as addressed in the video, is not the<br>
        way that I picture it. In the video, they related it to ecosystems and<br>
        the natural world, relaying that the world was built on feedback loops<br>
        and that every person was just a part of a bigger system. In my mind,<br>
        I visualize cybernetics like wires connecting technology and society<br>
        digitally. I think about the service networks in Newark, New Jersey<br>
        that fuel Wall Street’s stock market. When I think about cybernetics<br>
        like an ecosystem, however, I feel a responsibility to keep the natural<br>
        world in my peripheral vision. It feels like something that should not<br>
        be forgotten in day to day actions.<br>
        </p>
      <p>
        As for the way that cybernetics relates to culture, the video brought<br>
        up a governor of South Africa dominating over marginalized groups in<br>
        the sixties. The feedback loop comparison made it seem like nature is<br>
        a never-changing force, and that no matter what humans do, the<br>
        environment will counteract upon these actions and continue its<br>
        stabilization. When using this understanding of nature to create a<br>
        framework for social dynamics, marginalized groups are perpetually<br>
        disempowered. The white European dominance is reinforced. However,<br>
        cybernetics should not be understood in this way when being used as<br>
        a framework to relate to humans. I think that cybernetics shows that<br>
        we should be held accountable for our actions. We are interrelated<br>
        with the natural world, and to each other. It is our duty, as parts<br>
        of the grand system, to put our best foot forward and pick up our<br>
        weakest links. If cybernetics was seen in this light, then our<br>
        societies would run smoother, and politicians would not corruptly<br>
        override the good of their people. We should all learn from the past<br>
        so that we can live a splendid future. Cybernetics should be used to<br>
        uncover what is practical in social organization, not necessarily what<br>
        is ideal - this is one critique I have of the ways that cybernetics has<br>
        been applied in real life like the communes. We should not live in a<br>
        fantasy, but rather, optimize the real world.

    <h2>#ACCELERATE MANIFESTO for an Accelerationist Politics</h2>
    <p>The manifesto that we read for homework rejected neoliberalism and<br>
      capitalism, illustrating the ways that democracy in the modern era has<br>
      failed us due to greed, and globalization. The author supported Marxism<br>
      and his principles, saying that communism was the most efficient and<br>
      ultimate form of economic and social organization - he/she was not<br>
      overly critical of this economic model and for that, I felt like I was<br>
      critical of the manifesto. However, the rejection of neoliberalism,<br>
      post-economic crisis, and the rejection of capitalism are two principles<br>
      I support. Our society is too focused on materialism and greed.<br>
      Technological advancement seems to further perpetuate these inevitable<br>
      results of capitalism. When I think about the proposed post-capitalism,<br>
      I see it as an economic model that rejects greed and sees technology as a<br>
      tool for social connection and a responsibility to help the earth.
    </p>
    <p>Part of the rejection of our current economic models involves the word<br>
      acceleration, rather than progress. I see the use of the former word just<br>
      like social scientists using the word equity instead of equality. The<br>
      latter is like a post-it word - it has great social context that makes<br>
      its definition expand beyond its literal meaning. Progress has been used<br>
      to cover up oppression too much in history, which is the reason why the<br>
      author favors the word acceleration in my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>As for gender involvement in this article, I felt like the manifesto<br>
      wrote in such a way that it completely disregarded the difference between<br>
      genders. I understand that this stance is used to act as an umbrella for<br>
      every citizen of the world, however, the social experience of a person<br>
      is very much dependent on their gender identity. There are physiological<br>
      differences between men and women, ones that we cannot change if we want<br>
      our species to live beyond our time. A woman is expected to stay at<br>
      home for a time after having a child, not just due to historical context,<br>
      but also because there is usually a connection between mother and child<br>
      that begins in the womb. This connection is important to nurture, and<br>
      as such, the disregard of various gender experiences in the manifesto<br>
      enunciates how our society is still refusing to accept differences among<br>
      different identity groups that any amount of social groups will be<br>
      able to change.

    <h2>Breathing, Chapters 1 & 5<br> by Franco "Bifo" Berardi</h2>
    <p>The recent piece about poetry spoke about our relation to prose, and why<br>
       it is relevant in the modern world. I have always felt as though poetry <br>
       describes aspects of life that the common person cannot wrap their<br>
      finger around. It is creates meaning by combining words that otherwise <br>
      would never be compared or contrasted. Poetry gives us a new way to <br>
      understand language and a new way to look at the world around us. This <br>
      sort of meaning-making is best understood while learning a new language <br>
      other than our mother-tongue. In this practice, we hear new words that <br>
      have a common meaning with how we naturally see the world. Suddenly, <br>
      prose and words take on a new light, and meaning is bent to the will of <br>
      the mind. Before college, I took French for nearly a decade. It is a <br>
      beautiful and rhythmic language that not only helps one learn English <br>
      -and its origin- but also ways that the learner can revisualize the world <br>
      around them. My French teacher Mme Dahn had us read many french poets. <br>
      We read Pascal, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, and Hugo. The way the words were <br>
      strung was beautiful and mysterious and creative. It helped us learn <br>
      French greater than we had before, but it also helped my classmates and <br>
      I set new eyes on the world. It became more vibrant than before, and I <br>
      encourage everyone to explore the greatness of prose.</p>

    <h1>weekly 8</h1>
    <h2>Gender Accelerationism: G/ACC</h2>
    <p>This weekly discussed the gender politics associated with computer <br>
      programming and the context behind those politics. It is sort of like a <br>
      cycle - the trans woman has the greatest connection to technology -what <br>
      I like thinking as “cracking” the code. Yet, by identifying with <br>
      femininity, these trans women complicate the visual that computer <br>
      programming is a man’s occupation. Women are seen as second-class to men, <br>
      and that they mimic masculinity if they try to reach for more power. <br>
      However, the powerful trans women mimic feminine aspects. The circle <br>
      relating computer programming and technology to one gender over another <br>
      is either completed or complicated by trans women. There is another <br>
      aspect of gender politics that the article mentions, this being <br>
      reproduction and the continuation of humans as a species. The <br>
      introduction of the Internet and the expanded technologies available now <br>
      tend to oversexualize feminity, and what is desired in a woman. The text <br>
      says that this complicates reproduction by creating a desire among men <br>
      for a robotic or digital woman, making them compromise their own ability <br>
      to carry on the species. The trans woman has, too, given up this <br>
      possibility. Therefore, the entire identity of technology implies the end <br>
      of the human race, and that there cannot be a gender associated with it. <br>
      Humanity can make the entire system come crashing down, and introduce <br>
      another bout of neo-classicism, in which, the female resorts to a <br>
      reproductive occupation. However, it is not likely that technology will <br>
      be tossed aside now that it has become incredibly useful. Therefore, <br>
      technology should not have a gender assigned to it.</p>
